# Dataset of speeds and distance between cars  
- The videos were created and rendered using Blender software, aiming to produce standardized videos with controlled environments.  
- The cars' speeds are constant throughout the entire route and in all videos.  
- The highway dimensions are 10x100m.  

## 6 videos rendered at 30 FPS  

  1. Five cars at different speeds—90, 120, 50, 2, and 1 km/h—without license plates.  
  2. Five cars at low speeds—1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 km/h—with different license plates.  
  3. Two cars with identical license plates.  
  4. Two cars, one stationary and one moving, to simulate a collision.  
  5. Five cars with fixed distances—24m between the 1st row and the 2nd; 11m between the 2nd row and the 3rd.  
  6. Distance measurement test: one car at 5 km/h approaching a stationary person (video to be added)

## 2 videos rendered at 60 FPS  

  1. Two cars—100 and 80 km/h—without license plates.  
  2. Five cars at different speeds—5, 10, 50, 80, and 100 km/h—without license plates.
